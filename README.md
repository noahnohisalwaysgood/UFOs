# Summary
* Drawback
  * The data has not been updated. We would have studied and gathered more researches of UFOs, if we had most recent datas.
  * The data is geopolitically limited within USA. There are many UFOs sighting spots in the world.
  * placeholder does not allow upper case.

 * Recommendations
  * The UFOs sighting data needs to be updated in order not only to collect recent data but also develop the UFOs study.
  * Data search needs to be flexable. ex) the system currently does not work with upper case letters.
